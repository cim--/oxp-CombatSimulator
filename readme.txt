This OXP adds a combat simulator to some stations (generally the
higher-tech ones) where you can set up controlled battles against
particular opponents. To start a fight, go to the interfaces screen
(F4) and select "Combat Simulator". Then, select the ships, skill, and
numbers of your opponent(s).

The fight will end if:
 - you defeat all your opponents
 - your ship would be destroyed
 - the simulator buoy is destroyed
 - you leave scanner range of the simulator buoy

You will not be able to use an escape pod or hyperspace during the
simulation.

All damage taken, consumable items used, etc. during the fight will
not be applied to your real ship. The ship you fly in the simulator
will be your current ship in whatever state it is currently in.

There is no charge for using the simulator, but it is a popular
service and there is often a queue. Expect to wait around ten minutes
for your turn.

This OXP requires Ship Storage Helper OXP and will not run without it
